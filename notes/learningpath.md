    -   Choose an IDE or editor (e.g., VS Code, CLion, or Vim).
    -   Install Git and set up a GitHub account for version control.

2.  **Core C Concepts**
    -   Variables, data types (int, char, float, etc.), and operators.
    -   Control structures (if-else, loops: for, while, do-while).
    -   Functions: declaration, definition, and recursion.
    -   Arrays and strings.
    -   Pointers and memory management (malloc, free).
    -   Structures, unions, and enums.

3.  **Git Basics**
    -   Initialize a repository (`git init`).
    -   Track changes (`git add`, `git commit`).
    -   Push to GitHub (`git push`) and clone repositories (`git clone`).
    -   Create a simple C project (e.g., a calculator) and commit it to GitHub.

4.  **Resources**
    -   Book: *C Programming Absolute Beginner’s Guide* by Perry and Miller.
    -   Online: FreeCodeCamp C tutorial or [Learn-C.org](https://www.learn-c.org/).
    -   Practice: Write small programs (e.g., factorial calculator, string reverser).

## Phase 2: Intermediate C and System Programming
**Goal**: Dive into low-level programming and system-level concepts critical for system programming.

1.  **Memory and Pointers Deep Dive**
    -   Pointer arithmetic and multi-level pointers.
    -   Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
    -   Avoiding memory leaks and dangling pointers.

2.  **File I/O**
    -   Reading/writing files (fopen, fread, fwrite, fclose).
    -   Binary vs. text file handling.
    -   Error handling with errno and perror.

3.  **System Programming Basics**
    -   Process management: fork(), exec(), wait().
    -   Inter-process communication (pipes, shared memory).
    -   Signals and signal handling.
    -   Threads with POSIX threads (pthread library).

4.  **Git Workflow**
    -   Branching (`git branch`, `git checkout`) for experimenting with system code.
    -   Merging and resolving conflicts (`git merge`).
    -   Use `.gitignore` for compiled binaries (e.g., *.o, a.out).

5.  **Projects**
    -   Build a simple shell (command interpreter).
    -   Create a multi-threaded file copier.
    -   Commit projects to GitHub with clear READMEs.

6.  **Resources**
    -   Book: *The C Programming Language* by Kernighan & Ritchie (K&R).
    -   Book: *Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment* by Stevens.
    -   Online: [Beej’s Guide to C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/) and [Beej’s Guide to UNIX System Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgusp/).

## Phase 3: Backend Web Development with C
**Goal**: Apply C to backend development, focusing on performance-critical systems.

1.  **Networking Basics**
    -   Sockets programming (TCP/IP, UDP).
    -   Client-server model with Berkeley sockets.
    -   Handling multiple clients with select() or threads.

2.  **HTTP and Web Servers**
    -   Understand HTTP protocol (requests, responses, headers).
    -   Build a basic web server in C:
        -   Parse HTTP requests.
        -   Serve static files (HTML, images).
        -   Handle basic routing.
    -   Use libraries like libevent or mongoose for efficiency (optional).

3.  **Data Handling**
    -   Integrate with lightweight databases (e.g., SQLite) for dynamic content.
    -   Parse JSON or XML (using libraries like cJSON or libxml2).

4.  **Git for Collaboration**
    -   Work with remote repositories and pull requests.
    -   Tag releases (`git tag`) for stable server versions.
    -   Use GitHub Actions for automated builds/tests.

5.  **Projects**
    -   Build a minimal HTTP server that serves a webpage.
    -   Extend it to handle GET/POST requests with SQLite backend.
    -   Host the project on GitHub and deploy it on a VPS (e.g., AWS EC2).

6.  **Resources**
    -   Book: *Beej’s Guide to Network Programming* ([https://beej.us/guide/bgnp/](https://beej.us/guide/bgnp/)).
    -   Online: Tutorials on socket programming and SQLite in C.
    -   Explore: Nginx source code (written in C) for inspiration.

## Phase 4: Advanced Topics and Optimization
**Goal**: Master advanced C techniques and optimize for real-world system and backend use cases.

1.  **Performance Optimization**
    -   Profiling tools (gprof, valgrind).
    -   Memory management optimization (cache efficiency, alignment).
    -   Writing efficient algorithms in C.

2.  **Security**
    -   Buffer overflow prevention.
    -   Secure coding practices (input validation, sanitization).
    -   Use of tools like ASan (AddressSanitizer) for debugging.

3.  **Scalability**
    -   Multi-threading vs. multi-processing for servers.
    -   Load balancing basics.
    -   Asynchronous I/O with epoll or kqueue.

4.  **Git Advanced**
    -   Rebasing (`git rebase`) for clean history.
    -   Stashing changes (`git stash`) during debugging.
    -   Collaborate on a C-based open-source project on GitHub.

5.  **Capstone Project**
    -   Build a production-ready web server:
        -   Supports RESTful API endpoints.
        -   Integrates SQLite or a custom key-value store.
        -   Handles concurrent connections efficiently.
    -   Deploy it with Git and document the process.

## Timeline
-   **Phase 1**: 1-2 months (beginner level).
-   **Phase 2**: 2-3 months (intermediate system programming).
-   **Phase 3**: 2-3 months (backend development).
